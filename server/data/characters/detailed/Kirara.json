This will also briefly apply Dendro to Kirara.\nThe shield will absorb Dendro DMG with 250% effectiveness. The shield's DMG absorption will be based on Kirara's Max HP and will not exceed a certain percentage of that Max HP. The remaining DMG absorption on a Shield of Safe Transport will stack on a new one when it is created, and its duration will reset.\n\nHold\nOut of her desire to \"deliver within half a day,\" Kirara deploys a Shield of Safe Transport identical to the one that can be created by (pressing/tapping) the skill. She will also curl up into a special express delivery box, entering the Urgent Neko Parcel state in order to move and fight more swiftly.\n\nUrgent Neko Parcel\nDeals Dendro DMG to opponents she crashes into. This effect can be triggered once on each opponent every 0.5s.\nWhen in this state, Kirara's movement speed, climbing speed, and jumping power are all increased, and her Stamina Consumption from climbing is increased.\nWhen the duration ends or the skill is used again, a Flipclaw Strike more powerful than the attack in the (Press/Tap) Mode will be unleashed, dealing AoE Dendro DMG.\nThe Urgent Neko Parcel state lasts a maximum of 10s. When the state ends, the skill will enter CD. The longer Kirara spends in this state, the longer the CD will be.\nSprinting or actively canceling climbing will end this state early.\n",

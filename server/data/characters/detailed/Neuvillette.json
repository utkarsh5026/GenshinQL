In this state, Neuvillette can move and change facing, and also absorb any Sourcewater Droplets in a certain AoE.\nEvery Droplet he absorbs will increase the formation speed of the Seal, and will heal Neuvillette.\nWhen the charging is stopped, if the Symbol has yet to be formed, then a Charged Attack will be unleashed. If it has been formed, then a Charged Attack: Equitable Judgment will be unleashed.\n\nCharged Attack\nConsumes a fixed amount of Stamina to attack opponents with a rupturing blast of water, dealing AoE Hydro DMG.\n\nCharged Attack: Equitable Judgment\nUnleashes surging torrents, dealing continuous AoE Hydro DMG to all opponents in a straight-line area in front of him.\nEquitable Judgment will not consume any Stamina and lasts 3s.\nIf Neuvillette's HP is above 50%, he will continuously lose HP while using this attack.\n\nPlunging Attack\nGathering the might of Hydro, Neuvillette plunges towards the ground from mid-air, damaging all opponents in his path. Deals AoE Hydro DMG upon impact with the ground.\n",

Different effects will occur based on the time spent charging.\nCharge Level 1: Fires off a Pyro-infused arrow, dealing Pyro DMG.\nCharge Level 2: Fires off a Prop Arrow that deals Pyro DMG, and upon hit, it will summon a Grin-Malkin Hat.\nWhen firing the Prop Arrow, and when Lyney has more than 60% HP, he will consume a portion of his HP to obtain 1 Prop Surplus stack. Max 5 stacks. The effect will be removed after the character spends 30s out of combat.\nThe lowest Lyney can drop to through this method is 60% of his Max HP.\n\nGrin-Malkin Hat\nCan taunt nearby opponents and attract their attacks. Each opponent can only be taunted by the Hat once every 5s.\nThe Hat will inherit a percentage of Lyney's Max HP.\nIf destroyed, or if its duration expires, it will fire off a Pyrotechnic Strike at 1 nearby opponent, dealing Pyro DMG.\nOnly 1 Hat can exist at any given time.\n\nArkhe: Pneuma\nAt certain intervals, the Prop Arrow will cause a Spiritbreath Thorn to descend upon its hit location, dealing Pneuma-aligned Pyro DMG.\n",

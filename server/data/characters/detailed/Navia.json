When all 11 Rosula Shardshots strike, 200% of the original amount of DMG is dealt.\nIn addition, when more than 3 stacks of Crystal Shrapnel are consumed, every stack consumed beyond those 3 will increase the DMG dealt by this Gunbrella attack by an additional 15%.\n\nHold\nEnter Aiming Mode, continually collecting nearby Elemental Shards created by Crystallize reactions.

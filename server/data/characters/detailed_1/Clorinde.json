Using her Elemental Skill will transform it into \"Impale the Night\": Perform a lunging attack, dealing Electro DMG. The DMG done through the aforementioned method is considered Normal Attack DMG.\n\nSwift Hunt\nWhen her Bond of Life is equal to or greater than 100% of her max HP: Performs a pistolet shot.\nWhen her Bond of Life is less than 100%, firing her pistolet will grant her Bond of Life, with the amount gained based on her max HP. The shots she fires can pierce opponents, and DMG dealt to opponents in their path is increased.\n\nImpale the Night\nThe current percentage value of Clorinde's Bond of Life determines its effect:\nWhen the Bond of Life value is 0%, perform a normal lunging strike;\nWhen the Bond of Life value is less than 100% of her max HP, Clorinde is healed based on the Bond of Life value, and the AoE of the lunging attack and the DMG dealt is increased;\nWhen the value of the Bond of Life is equal to or greater than 100% of her max HP, use Impale the Night: Pact. The healing multiplier is increased, and the AoE and DMG dealt by the lunge is increased even further.\n\nIn addition, when Clorinde is in the Night Vigil state, healing effects other than Impale the Night will not take effect and will instead be converted into a Bond of Life that is a percentage of the healing that would have been received.\n\nClorinde will exit the \"Night Vigil\" state when she leaves the field.\n\nArkhe: Ousia\nPeriodically, when Clorinde's Swift Hunt shots strike opponents, she will summon a Surging Blade at the position hit that deals Ousia-aligned Electro DMG.\n",

She will enter Fiery Passion when she reaches maximum Nightsoul points via this method, or when she uses her Elemental Burst Guardian Vent!\nWhile in the Fiery Passion state, her Normal Attacks, Elemental Skill, and Elemental Burst will gain unique buffs. She can also use a special Elemental Burst shortly after using a Plunging Attack.\nThe Fiery Passion state lasts for up to 15s and will end when she runs out of Nightsoul points or after she leaves combat for a period of time.",

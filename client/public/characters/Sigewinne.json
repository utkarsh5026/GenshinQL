Each tier it grows increases its DMG by 5% and healing by 5%. When a Bolstering Bubblebalm bounces, it will drop down a tier in size, until it returns to being a normal Bolstering Bubblebalm.\nAfter weaker opponents are hit by big Bolstering Bubblebalms, they will be imprisoned and will be unable to move.\n\nIn addition, 2 Sourcewater Droplets will be created near Sigewinne when she uses this Skill.

This can trigger once every 0.1s.\n\nAfter using this, Mavuika gains 10 Nightsoul points and enters the Nightsoul's Blessing state. Riding her Flamestrider high in the air, she uses a powerful Sunfell Slice against opponents on the ground, dealing Nightsoul-aligned AoE Pyro DMG and entering the \"Crucible of Death and Life\" state.\n\nCrucible of Death and Life\nDuring this time, Mavuika's various actions will no longer consume Nightsoul points, and her interruption resistance is increased.

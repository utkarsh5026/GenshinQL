While in this state, Jahoda moves continuously and swiftly: If nearby opponents are affected by Pyro, Hydro, Electro, or Cryo, she will quietly convert her Purr-loined Treasure Flask\n\n\n\n\n\nto that element, gradually filling it. When the duration ends or the skill is used again, Jahoda drains the Purr-loined Treasure Flask and deals a single instance of Anemo DMG to nearby opponents. When the Purr-loined Treasure Flask is full, Jahoda immediately drains it, exiting the Shadow Pursuit state and dealing a more powerful instance of Anemo DMG.\nIf her dash fails to make contact with an opponent, Jahoda instead drops a Smoke Bomb at her location, dealing a single instance of Anemo DMG to nearby opponents.\n\nMoonsign: Ascendant Gleam: When the Purr-loined Treasure Flask becomes full, Jahoda will not immediately discharge it. Instead, for a short duration, she steadily consumes the stored element inside and periodically fires Fluffy Meowballs at nearby opponents, dealing DMG of the corresponding element stored in the Purr-loined Treasure Flask. When a Fluffy Meowball hits an opponent, Jahoda regenerates 2 Elemental Energy. This effect can be triggered once every 3.5s.",
